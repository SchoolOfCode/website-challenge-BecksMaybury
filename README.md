# Website Challenge - my thoughts

## Initial Research

* Looked at blogger profiles to see what kind of information was often included, general layouts.
* Considered the types of activities already undertaken in bootcamp live sessions to help us connect, questions people asked to get to know each other better.  
* Formulated a list of questions for my pair partner, including preferences around style/color.
* First zoom meeting with pair partner.
* Reassessed my thoughts on presentation and content - my pair partner did not want to include basic info (eg age, current occupation, why SOC etc; pair partner has a strong preference for a very simple looking, monochrome site.
* Looked at some examples of good black and white websites for design inspiration.

## Development journey

I started by creating a basic html page and adding standard block elements.  

I then linked a CSS file and gradually built up some basic content, experimenting with backgrounds, colors, positions, borders, simple grids.  Lots of trial and error here which, whilst time consuming, helped consolidate my understanding so far, especially re use of classes, use of block and inline elements.

Talked to my pair partner about research shared by other bootcampers about what was important to include and, from this, added some further content.

### Version 1

Most of a basic design is done here.  I've experimented with a drop-shadow filter with a fixed header but am struggling to get the text to disappear behind the header with this set. I've found out how to get text to change appearance and have more text appear on hover which works well. 

I would like to simplify it further and have 4 central images which, when clicked, show the information in a section.

The colors need some further work to better fit the client brief of monochrome.

### Version 2

Following some learning around flexbox, I redesigned the layout and used the principle of : hover ~.hide to only make certain boxes visible on hover.  This works well when the additional content that appears does not need the user to scroll to see it all (it is hidden as soon as the focus is lost from the icon.  Sought expert help (Tao) and I am likely to need JavaScript to achieve the effect I want :(

Workaround: changed the layout for all the information to be on one page, setting margins to make the boxes the desired height, giving each box an id which is called when an icon in the header is clicked - this gives an initial impression of information appearing on call.  

I found out how to add links to external sites, including to social media profiles and Spotify playlists.

I altered the background to make it more like downloaded images and edited them in Paint to make them the right color.

I found out how to scale the size of an element on hover and incorporated this.
This is the version I have submitted as my Checkpoint Challenge.

## Further development

If I had more time I would

* Add @mediaQuery
* Change the CSS code to use proportions of viewHeight and viewWidth instead of setting pixel/font/image etc sizes to make sure all content resizes responsively
* Work out how to hide all other questions in the section once the user hovers over one and reveals the answer

## Learning points moving forward (apart from all the amazing stuff I've learned in HTML and CSS in the last 2 weeks!)

* Use comments in both HTML and CSS as I go along to make it easier to find the code I want
* Use proportions instead of discrete sizes
* Spend more time visualising the overall layout before starting (this will be easier now I have an idea of how things work) 

## Final thoughts

Despite it's simplicity (and inherent flaws) I'm really pleased to have made this amount of progress.  I knew nothing at all about HTML or CSS prior to this and feel like I have a good grasp of the basics now.  My pair partner is pleased with the final "product", so happy days!
