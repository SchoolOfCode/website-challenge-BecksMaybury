# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.

## My thoughts

Research

* Looked at blogger profiles to see what kind of information was often included, general layouts.
* Considered the types of activities already undertaken in bootcamp live sessions to help us connect, questions people asked to get to know each other better.  
* Formulated a list of questions for my pair partner, including preferences around style/color.
* First zoom meeting with pair partner.
* Reassessed my thoughts on presentation and content - pair partner did not want to include basic info (eg age, current occupation, why SOC etc; pair partner has a strong preference for a monochrome site with simple lines.

Primary Development

Started by creating a basic html page and adding standard block elements.  
Linked CSS file and gradually built up some basic content, experimenting with backgrounds, colors, positions, borders, simple grids.  Lots of trial and error here which, whilst time consuming, helped consolidate my understanding so far, especially re use of classes, use of block and inline elements.

Most of a basic design done.  I've experimented with drop-shadow v fixed headers (a battle that is still in progress), found out how to get text to change appearance and have more text appear on hover 

I would like to simplify it further and have 4 central images which, when clicked, show the information in a section.  Research needed.

Kept reviewing code to see if it was as efficient as I could make it.  Look at shorthand for
